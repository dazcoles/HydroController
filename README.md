# HydroController

## Introduction
The hydro controller is an all-in-one system which is designed to maintain the entire grow environment the features include:
<ul>
  <li>EC/TDS and PH control via 4 to 6 peristaltic pumps and a PH and EC sensor.</li>
  <li>Water level maintenance which includes the ability to drain and refill the water using either an ultra-sonic sensor or a E-tape water level sensor and two water pumps one for the water inlet and another for the water outlet, with each pump controlled by a relay.</li>
  <li>Water temperature control via DS18B20 and a water heater controlled by a relay.</li>
  <li>Air teperature control (temperature and humidity) via a dual AC zero-point cross module and a DHT22 and a relay to control an exter AC heater.</li>
  <li>AC light timer (on/off/auto timer) via a DS3231 RTC and a relay module.</li>
  <li>Co2 cotrol via a MH-Z14 CO2 Sensor Carbon Dioxide Sensor and a relay module (external Co2 solenoid and flow rate meter required).</li>
  <li>Local Wifi access point with a Hydro controller GUI to view and adjust values remotely, via a ESP8266-01.</li>
  <li>800x480 RA8875 touch screen TFT display with an intuitive GUI design</li>
</ul>



### Suppprt the project
Please help to support the hydro controller project by donating towards its research and development, it takes me alot of time and money for me to design and producde new PCBs and manage the code so any donation is welcome and thankyou for your intrest in the hydro controller project.
