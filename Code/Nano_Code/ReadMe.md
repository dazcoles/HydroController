I have added two different codes for the Arduino Nano, one is for a PCB that uses N-Channel Mosfets for the RGB LED, and another that is for a PCB that uses P-Channel Mosfets for the RGB LED, note the naming of file to indictae which is which.

Additianlly make sure to adjust the "halfWave" variable in the nanoCode to suit for VAC frequency, 100 for 50Hz VAC, or 83 for 60Hz VAC.
