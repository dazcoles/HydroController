Before uploading the code make sure you have installed the librarys provided in the code folder.

See the Hydro master Wiring and Testing document in the Supporting materials folder for the basic wiring illustrations 
or the gerber files in the PCB folder for details wiring diagrams.

The wiring diagram needs to be updated, as the controller now uses the DF Robot Pro PH sensor version 2.0, as such the digital pot and dip switch between an analog or digital pot is no longer required.

Upload the nanoCode to an Arduino Nano or Arduino Uno.
Upload the hydroControllerV4.9.4 to an Arduino Mega2560.
Upload the esp8266 to an esp8266-01.
